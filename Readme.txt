Business Requirements: 
Background: 
Tracking statistics for fitness is essential for athletes who want to improve themselves and their bodies. Our goal is to provide a convenient place to store and track all data relating to an athlete’s goals and needs. Currently, that data is usually split up between a plethora of applications, and we wish to unify all of them into one. 
 
Opportunity: 
Athletes need a place where they can store and track all of their data. We believe that the current apps on the market do not make this convenient or easy. Our application will prove to be both more functional and more practical for an athlete’s needs. 
 
Business Objectives and Success: 
Athletes need to have a reliable way to track their data because without it, it would be impossible to tell if their efforts are paying off. Being able to track calories, weight, and other statistics all in one place allow you to easily analyze trends and determine whether you need to make changes to your routine. The user will know this app is a success if they can easily identify trends and changes in their lifestyle based off the data that they log. Other key identifiers of success would be things like ease of use and readability. The app needs to be intuitive and easy to input data, as well as clear and concise when looking at trends and statistics. 
 
Customer and Market Needs: 
The industry requires this solution because the current apps are not easy/intuitive. The most popular applications on the market are things like Apple Health and MyFitnessPal. While both apps allow the tracking and input of some data, both of them have glaring holes in the types of data they track. Neither app will track specific exercises, rep counts, or weights for workouts.  

Business Risks:
	The biggest risk of the project would simply be that the app doesn’t work, or we miss our development goals within the timeframe for development. This project is not being run for profit, but rather to gain experience and knowledge within the field of app development. So there is no risk of losing money, but rather the risk of wasted time. I think the best way to avoid this risk is to have clear outline/timeline on what we need to accomplish and by when. This will allow
